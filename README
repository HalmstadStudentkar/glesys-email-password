As GleSYS does not provide a way for the end users to change their
passwords we need some hack to make it happen.

 Install and setup

 Dependencies:
 * The GleSYS API PHP class available.
   -> git clone git@github.com:GleSYS/API.git
 * A web server with PHP where the IMAP module is available
   -> in Debian based systems you need the php5-imap package.
   -> for RPM based setup you'll find a php-imap package.

 Set your web server to serve the index.php file of this
 repository. Copy example.config.php to local.config.php and place it
 one step up in the path from index.php. Adjust the content to match
 your setup. Do not forget to add the originating IP of the web server
 to the API access token in the GleSYS administration panel.
 The API access token only need "editaccount" in email to be allowed
 to work.
